# LBS_non3G
Software related with the technology developd for providing Location-Based Services on Degraded Communication Environments.
As Degraded Communication Environments we consider environments where the availability of high-speed communications is not guarantee in at least the 75% of the time. This includes areas with limited access to 3G/4G/Wifi communication coverage. Otherwise, it is considered Non Degraded Communication Environments.
This software has been used in several experiments done by the IAAA-Lab team.
